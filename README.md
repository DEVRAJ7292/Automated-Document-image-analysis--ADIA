# ADIA — Automated Document Intelligence

ADIA is an end-to-end document intelligence system that ingests PDFs and images, extracts text intelligently, and answers natural-language questions over the content.

It is designed as a **production-style backend**, not a tutorial project.

##  What ADIA Does

- Upload PDFs or images
- Native PDF text extraction (OCR fallback only when needed)
- Text normalization for dates and amounts
- Semantic embeddings with vector search
- Question answering using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- Clean UI for demo and client interaction
- Fully containerized with Docker
